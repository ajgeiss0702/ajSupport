  "rewards":"Hello! I am here to help you set up rewards in the parkour!\n\nFirst, open rewards.yml. You will see two sections: intervals and exceptions.\n\nIntervals will activate at an interval you specify. So if you set the interval to 10, it would activate every 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc jumps.\n\nExceptions are exceptions to intervals that will only activate on the score you specify. If you put the exception to 5, it will only activate once the player reaches 5 and no other time.\n\nFor more information, please read the docs on rewards: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajparkour/configs/Rewards/",

When you are having issues with ajqueue detecting incorrect server info (offline, incorrect player count, whitelisted status) there is a step you should complete that will help find the issue\nIn the config, change `pinger-debug` to `true`, then do `/ajq reload`.\nNow wait a minute or so, and then send your logs here (using a paste site such as <https://paste.ajg0702.us> ).",

  "hdv3": "In newer version of HolographicDisplays (since 3.0.0 beta 2), they’ve changed the placeholder format to be non-standard. You either need to use their weird format, use an older version of HolographicDisplays (with HolographicExtension), or switch to another hologram plugin.\n\nIf you switch to another hologram plugin, I recommend DecentHolograms. It also has a [command to convert from HolographicDisplays](<https://wiki.decentholograms.eu/general/compatibility#holographicdisplays>)",
  "h2": "Please upgrade to h2!\nh2 is like sqlite, but a __lot__ faster.\nTo switch to h2, first use `/ajlb export`. Then open `cache_storage.yml` and change `method` to `h2`.

If you download it from the main page, you will probably get the release version, which will probably not have the changes im asking you to try.\nPrereleases should have `-b` then a number at the end. For example: `2.0.0-b12`",
  "statisticreset": "Hello!\nTo reset minecraft's statistics, you need to first shut down the server. Once it is shut down, open the `world` folder.\nIf you want to reset everyone's statistics, delete the `stats` folder.\nIf you only want to reset a certain person's stats, then open the stats folder and find their UUID, and delete that file.\nNow start the server, and all stats should be reset. If they are not, make sure you fully shut down the server before deleting the stats folder and try again.",

The one I can help you with is statistic. If you are wanting to reset a player's statistics, run the discord command `/statisticreset` here for more info.\n\nOnce you reset the data in the target placeholder, run `/ajlb reset <board>` to clear the ajLeaderboards cache for that board.\nOnce you do that, players will need to join to show on the leaderboard again, just like when you first set it up.",
  "offline": "Hello!\nIf ajQueue is saying a server is offline when its not, and you are able to connect when going around ajQueue, then there are a few steps you can do.\nFirst, if you are on 1.16 or above, make sure that `enable-status` is set to `true` in the `server.properties` of the target server. This is the most common issue, so worth checking first.\nIf it is, check why ajQueue is marking the server as offline. Run the discord command `/pingerdebug` here for more info on how to do that.",
  "sparkthreads": "Hello!\nSpark thread counts are a __total__ of all threads that have been used during the profile time, not the amount that are currently running.\najLeaderboards creates threads when it needs to, then deletes them after they go unused for a bit.

In what way is it not working?**\nWhen requesting support, you need to give all of the information needed to help fix your issue.\nDo **not** just say 'it does not work' or 'its broken'. Instead, say exactly what is not working, and in what way it is not working. The more details you give, the easier it is to help you.\n\nAs a general guide, it is always good to **at least** provide the following info:\n* Which plugin you are asking about (e.g. ajLeaderboards, ajQueue, etc)\n* What (exactly) isn't working (e.g. \"Players are not showing up on the leaderboard\" or \"Players are being sent to the server instantly!\")\n* What you have tried to fix the issue already (e.g. \"negating the permission\" or \"making sure I am running the queue command\"\n* **Plenty of detail about the above pieces**. The exact commands or placeholders you tried should always be included. Sending your config might also be helpful, but this is not needed for most issues.\n\nWe are here to help, but please try to not waste our time by making us ask basic clarifying questions.",
