  "hd":"Hello! I am here to help you set up HolographicDisplays to work with PlaceholderAPI placeholders!\n\nFirstly, please download HolographicExtension (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/holographicextension.18461/) and ProtocolLib (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).\n\nOnce you have both of those plugins installed, you will be able to put PlaceholderAPI placeholders on holograms but they will not update correctly. To make them update, you will need to add a speed placeholder on each line with a placholder. Find the different speed placeholders on HolographicExtension's plugin page.\nHere is an example hologram line:```{medium}%ajpk_stats_highscore%```This will show the player's highscore and will update it every second.",

  "rewards":"Hello! I am here to help you set up rewards in the parkour!\n\nFirst, open rewards.yml. You will see two sections: intervals and exceptions.\n\nIntervals will activate at an interval you specify. So if you set the interval to 10, it would activate every 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc jumps.\n\nExceptions are exceptions to intervals that will only activate on the score you specify. If you put the exception to 5, it will only activate once the player reaches 5 and no other time.\n\nFor more information, please read the docs on rewards: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajparkour/configs/Rewards/",
