  "rewards":"Hello! I am here to help you set up rewards in the parkour!\n\nFirst, open rewards.yml. You will see two sections: intervals and exceptions.\n\nIntervals will activate at an interval you specify. So if you set the interval to 10, it would activate every 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc jumps.\n\nExceptions are exceptions to intervals that will only activate on the score you specify. If you put the exception to 5, it will only activate once the player reaches 5 and no other time.\n\nFor more information, please read the docs on rewards: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajparkour/configs/Rewards/",

It looks like you're using the old placeholders\n\nThe placeholders were changed in ajLeaderboards v2.0.0 in order to add support for timed leaderboards (daily, weekly, monthly, etc)\nIn most cases, you just have to add the `<type>` (which would be alltime, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly) to the placeholder after the `<number>`\n\nSee the full new placeholders here: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajLeaderboards/setup/placeholders",

  "hdv3": "In newer version of HolographicDisplays (since 3.0.0 beta 2), they’ve changed the placeholder format to be non-standard. You either need to use their weird format, use an older version of HolographicDisplays (with HolographicExtension), or switch to another hologram plugin.\n\nIf you switch to another hologram plugin, I recommend DecentHolograms. It also has a [command to convert from HolographicDisplays](<https://wiki.decentholograms.eu/general/compatibility#holographicdisplays>)",
  "h2": "Please upgrade to h2!\nh2 is like sqlite, but a __lot__ faster.\nTo switch to h2, first use `/ajlb export`. Then open `cache_storage.yml` and change `method` to `h2`.

If you download it from the main page, you will probably get the release version, which will probably not have the changes im asking you to try.\nPrereleases should have `-b` then a number at the end. For example: `2.0.0-b12`",

Once it is shut down, open the `world` folder.\nIf you want to reset everyone's statistics, delete the `stats` folder.\nIf you only want to reset a certain person's stats, then open the stats folder and find their UUID, and delete that file.\nNow start the server, and all stats should be reset. If they are not, make sure you fully shut down the server before deleting the stats folder and try again.",

The one I can help you with is statistic. If you are wanting to reset a player's statistics, run the discord command `/statisticreset` here for more info.\n\nOnce you reset the data in the target placeholder, run `/ajlb reset <board>` to clear the ajLeaderboards cache for that board.\nOnce you do that, players will need to join to show on the leaderboard again, just like when you first set it up.",
  "offline": "Hello!\nIf ajQueue is saying a server is offline when its not, and you are able to connect when going around ajQueue, then there are a few steps you can do.\nFirst, make sure that `enable-status` is set to `true` in the `server.properties` of the target server.\nIf it is, check why ajQueue is marking the server as offline. Run the discord command `/pingerdebug` here for more info on how to do that."
